Smart Max Tabs
========

Smart Max Tabs is a simple Firefox extension that does these:

- Set a `maximum` number of tabs opened in a window.
- Automatically close least used tabs, if `maximum` is exceeded.
- Save the automatically closed tabs in a searchable sidebar (From menu bar: View->Sidebar->closed tabs).
- Control and restrict oneself from opening too many tabs.
- Prevent tabs from overloading and overflowing the tab bar.


> **_NOTE:_** This is a personal web extension that I use. If you think it is useful, star it so you can signal me that I should improve it and make it easily available for everyone.

This project was originally forked from another extension called max-tabs that only limits the maximum number of open tabs: [https://github.com/kanru/max-tabs]()
