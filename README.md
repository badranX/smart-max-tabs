Smart Max Tabs
========

Smart Max Tabs is a simple Firefox extension that does these:

- Set a maximum number of tabs opened in a window.
- Close least used tabs.
- Save closed tabs in a searchable sidebar (in case you need them).
- Access closed tabs from sidebar, incase you need it.
- Control and restrict oneself from opening too many tabs.
- Prevent tabs from overloading and overflowing the tab bar.


Note this project was originally forked from another extension called max-tabs.
